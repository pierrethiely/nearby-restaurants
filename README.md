# **What's the project ?**

This project is generated with [**Angular CLI**](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 7.3.8.

# **How to use it ?**

- Just clone this repository with **git clone https://www.github.com/pierrethiely/nearby-restaurants.git** to get the project on your PC.
- Open the project and use the command **npm install** to install all the dependancies.
- For security reasons, I've hidden my API key, if you don't already have one, you can get one [**here**](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/get-api-key). 
- Once you have a **Google API key** to use JavaScript Maps, replace the string **YOUR_GOOGLE_API_KEY** (4 times) by your API key to use the project properly.

Now, run the Angular command **ng serve** to use the project. You can use the parameter **-o** to open it automatically, or navigate to **http://localhost:4200**.

# ***There you go, you can see where and what are the best restaurants near to you !***
